To generate the diagram shown in the README page in the project root:

1. Make sure you have Java installed
2. Open a terminal in the root of the project

Run:

```
java -jar plantuml.jar "State Diagram\stateDiagram.txt"
```

Each project subfolder contains one example of a PlantUML specifcation for a diagram, along with a README file. The README file includes a link to the page on the official PlantUML site from which that folder's example was taken. There are plenty more examples on the site to try out.
